# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

  Using Bootstrap, I recreated my first portfolio site with the following items:

  The website includes the following bootstrap components:

  A Navigation bar with a navigation menu at the top. 

  Links that are applicable to my portfolio. The links navigate to the appropriate sections. 

  A hero section with a jumbotron featuring my picture, my name, and some information about me.

  A work section with a section displaying my work in grid. Bootstrap cards used for each project with a brief overview of the work. Each project links to the relevant webpage!

  A skills section with a list of the skills I learnt from the bootcamp.

  An about / contact section.
    
  A footer section. All hyperlinks have a hover effect and all buttons display a box shadow upon hover.

The Bootstrap solution minimizes use of media queries.
