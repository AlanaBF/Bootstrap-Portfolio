                            <p class="card-text">Previously a secondary teacher of 20 years, currently upskilling to
                                become a Front End Web Developer. Recently completed Prince2 Project Management
                                Foundation, and in the process of completing Prince 2 Practitioner and Agile Foundation
                                and Practitioner certificates and a 16 week Skills Bootcamp in Front End Web
                                Development, using Zoom, Slack and Bootcamp Spot. I am excited to learn and develop
                                further as a Front End Web Developer. I am passionate, creative, a team worker, and
                                enjoy building projects from ideation to execution. As a teacher I have developed and
                                progressed in a number of different directions including; boarding house parent, teacher
                                of a number of different subjects, including; Animal Care, Physical Education,
                                Geography, Maths, Religious Education (RE), a hockey and cricket coach, challenging
                                myself to teach and live in Spain including as a Teaching English as a Foreign Language
                                (TEFL) teacher. As well as this I have been a Probation Supervising Officer, renovated a
                                house in Cornwall and started two big projects within my current role; starting and
                                establishing a school farm and initiating and managing the Duke of Edinburgh Award. The
                                most recent projects have been the most relevant to my decision to make a significant
                                career change. Through these roles I have developed and honed my ability to push myself
                                out of my comfort zone and developed a wide range of transferable soft skills. I am
                                always looking for ways to further develop and improve. I have high expectations and
                                promote a ‘can do’ mindset. As a patient person, I listen to others and offer a balanced
                                opinion. I enjoy trying to bring the best out in everyone. I am punctual and always
                                smartly turned out. I am highly motivated, have a good sense of humour and bags of
                                energy. I have shown the ability to work well under direction as well as off my own
                                initiative. I have good written and communication skills and excellent attention to
                                detail. I am very friendly and approachable. Outside of my career, I love the great
                                outdoors, my animals, sailing, water sports, camping, walking, gardening and travelling.

                        This Prework Study Guide gives the basic knowledge and skills to help embed the basics until it
                        becomes second nature.
                        In this Study Guide we learnt about HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript and Deployment.</p>

                        Semantic HTML elements can now be found throughout the source code
                        HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
                        Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
                        Heading attributes fall in sequential order
                        Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
                        The site is now optimized for search engines
                        I found, tested and fixed a broken link, I added comments throughout for future developers to
                        show
                        what has been done, I simplified the code to make it cleaner and easier to read. I added
                        semantic
                        code throughout and removed div elements..</p>
