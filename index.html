                    Semantic HTML elements can now be found throughout the source code
                    HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
                    Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
                    Heading attributes fall in sequential order
                    Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
                    The site is now optimized for search engines
                    I found, tested and fixed a broken link, I added comments throughout for future developers to
                    show
                    what has been done, I simplified the code to make it cleaner and easier to read. I added
                    semantic
                    code throughout and removed div elements..</p>
                <p class="card-quote">"Congratulations on an outstanding homework assignment! You were able to
                    demonstrate your ability to refactor a web app with HTML and CSS! On the same note, great job
                    ensuring your links are all functional and that they correctly navigate users to the appropriate
                    destination. You were able to ensure the organization and consolidation of your CSS selector
                    properties. You were also able to properly comment out your CSS/HTML code, this will be huge for
                    you when you go back to your work and try to understand the story and approach behind it! In
                    addition, great job deploying your application, you were able to correctly deploy to a live URL.
                    You took it a step further by demonstrating clean and organized coding conventions and deploying
                    a comprehensive repository with all required information! Just make sure to include a screenshot
                    of your application in your README file. Keep up the great work!" - “Central Grader TM”

                            developed and
                            progressed in a number of different directions including; boarding house parent,

                            renovated a

                            most recent projects have been the most relevant to my decision to make a
                            significant
                            career change. Through these roles I have developed and honed my ability to push

                            always looking for ways to further develop and improve. I have high expectations
                            and
                            promote a ‘can do’ mindset. As a patient person, I listen to others and offer a
                            balanced
                            opinion. I enjoy trying to bring the best out in everyone. I am punctual and
                            always
                            smartly turned out. I am highly motivated, have a good sense of humour and bags
                            of
                            energy. I have shown the ability to work well under direction as well as off my

                            initiative. I have good written and communication skills and excellent attention
